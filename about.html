    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At Guardian 4 Heroes, we are committed to supporting the mental wellness of our veterans through innovative, compassionate equine-facilitated psychotherapy-assisted training (EFPT). We aim to honor and uplift those who’ve served by providing a therapeutic space that encourages healing, emotional awareness, and a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded and operated by veteran advocate Sara Peterson, Guardian 4 Heroes began as a vision to offer something deeper — a space where veterans can engage in healing through meaningful connection with horses. Over time, we’ve grown into a community built on empathy, resilience, and the belief that true healing happens through understanding, connection, and nature.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
    <p>We blend traditional therapy with the transformative presence of horses, offering participants a unique way to work through PTSD, anxiety, depression, and other emotional challenges. Horses, as deeply intuitive animals, help mirror human emotion in an honest, nonjudgmental way, fostering breakthroughs that words alone often can’t reach.</p>
    <p>Our programs encourage personal growth through gentle yet powerful experiences that help individuals build self-esteem, establish boundaries, and reconnect with themselves and others.</p>
