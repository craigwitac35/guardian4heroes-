      <h3>What Is EFPT?</h3>
      <p>Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy Training involves engaging with horses to rebuild confidence, explore boundaries, and enhance self-esteem. Horses, attuned to human emotion, offer a unique and honest connection that facilitates deep healing and personal growth.</p>

        <h4>Nelly, or Nelly Bell</h4>
        <p>A 12-year-old Mustang mare, Nelly sometimes pretends she doesn’t want to be brushed or touched. But she'll always come back for snuggles and is constantly aware of your presence, ensuring your safety. She’s a true rock star.</p>

        <p>Rocket is the biggest of our bunch, both in size and personality! He loves to goof around and craves attention. You’d never guess this spirited horse is 26 years old—he’s truly ageless and full of life.</p>

            <p>“I’m Craig, a 35-year-old Army veteran who served in Afghanistan. After leaving the Army, I struggled with substance abuse and felt lost. I was hesitant to join Guardian 4 Heroes, especially since I was afraid of horses at first. But this program has been a game-changer. Working with the horses, especially Rocket—a spirited horse who’s a bit rebellious like me—has helped me find connection and healing. I’m learning to trust, grow, and even love horses in ways I never expected.” – Craig, Army Veteran</p>
