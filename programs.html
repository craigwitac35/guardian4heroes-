      <h3>Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy Training (EFPT)</h3>
      <p>EFPT is a therapeutic approach that involves working directly with horses to help individuals reconnect with themselves and others. Our programs provide a safe and nurturing environment where veterans can process trauma, build self-esteem, and develop healthy interpersonal skills. The intuitive nature of horses allows for authentic feedback and emotional breakthroughs.</p>

      <h3>Horsemanship & Skill Building</h3>
      <p>Participants learn practical horsemanship — grooming, leading, and understanding equine behavior — which enhances emotional regulation, confidence, and responsibility. These skills empower veterans to gain a sense of control and mastery, often lost due to trauma or transition stress.</p>

      <h3>Community & Peer Connection</h3>

      <h3>Why Horses?</h3>
      <p>Horses are incredibly responsive to human emotion. Their ability to mirror our non-verbal cues creates opportunities for self-discovery and therapeutic growth. They offer honest, immediate feedback in a judgment-free environment — an ideal partner in emotional recovery.</p>
